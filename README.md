Diguana
======

Diguana is a data-dependent extension of the [Iguana] (https://github.com/cwi-swat/iguana) parsing framewrok.

To run Diguana, you need the [Iguana branch or Rascal] (https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/tree/iguana). For the instructions
how to set up Rascal see [here] (https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/wiki/Rascal-Developers-Setup---Step-by-Step).

At the moment, Diguana is a prototype and you can only generate ATN grammars from a Rascal grammar (examples are in the 
[grammar] (https://github.com/afroozeh/diguana/tree/master/grammars)) directory). To do so
execute `save(#startSymbol, path)` method in the Rascal console.
